	Mathematical Concepts !

	-1 The function : f(z) = z^2 + c  | <== We put inside it some imaginary number and
		we re-enter the result of it into the same function , some value keep growing to infinity and
			some of them they loop in the same numbers !
				Those imaginary numbers that keep looping we can locate them on a refere orthonorme (repere orthonorme).
					if we highlighted  the imaginary numbers that loop we get that fractol shape on the refere orthonorme !
	
	-2 We have to do this for all the pixels on the screen we locate the pixel and deduce it's place on the repere
		and calculate it's result and highlighted it if it loops !



	Algorythm :

	-1 The Mandelbrot set is visualized by mapping each pixel on the screen to a corresponding complex number
		then iterating the Mandelbrot formula to determine if the number "escapes" (goes to infinity) or
			stays bounded, The iteration count is used to color the pixel




	To Do : 

	-1 OverFlows Handlig dZab !


	
	Questions : 

	-1 what about that  * zoom how does it work !

	-2 Why offset and shit
